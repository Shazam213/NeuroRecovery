## Project Overview

NeuroRecovery aims to make cognitive rehabilitation accessible remotely, enabling patients to perform exercises from home while caregivers and therapists can monitor their progress and adjust treatment plans in real-time. The platform uses Vultr’s scalable infrastructure, a machine learning-driven task generator, and adaptive EEG-based tracking to personalize each patient’s rehabilitation journey.

## Approach

1. **Personalized Cognitive Exercises**: AI-powered task generation tailored to the patient’s recovery requirements.
2. **Real-Time Adaptive Tracking**: Integration with EEG data to adjust the difficulty level of tasks based on the patient’s cognitive load.
3. **Remote Caregiver Insights**: Predictive analytics and progress tracking for real-time monitoring of the patient’s progress by caregivers and therapists.
4. **Interactive Chatbot Interface**: A Laravel-based conversational interface for seamless patient interaction, addressing queries related to cognitive analysis, exercises, and platform features.
5. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Deployed on Vultr  Engine with monitoring for resource efficiency and resilience.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
The platform is divided into five main layers:
- **Frontend**: Caregiver dashboard and chatbot UI.
- **Backend API**: Manages task requests, EEG data processing, and backend functionalities.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Task generation model (LLaMA 2) and adaptive tracking model (Reformer).
- **Storage & Database**: Vultr Block and Object Storage for patient records, logs, and datasets.
- **Cloud Infrastructure & Monitoring**: Uses Vultr Kubernetes and Prometheus for real-time monitoring and scalability.

### Network Topology
The NeuroRecovery platform is deployed and interconnected on Vultr’s cloud infrastructure:
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Hosts API, machine learning models, and dashboards.
- **Storage**: Vultr Block Storage for logs and Object Storage for datasets.
- **Compute Instances**: Manages data processing and API requests for real-time interaction.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus monitors resources across nodes, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Key Features

1. **Personalized Exercise Generator**:
   - **Model**: LLaMA 2 
   - **Functionality**: Generates cognitive tasks tailored to patient profiles, aligning with cognitive exercise requirements from CogAtlas. Due to the lack of GPU access, we were unable to fine-tune the model and had to rely solely on prompt engineering to generate cognitive tasks tailored to patient profiles. These tasks were designed using **Vultr’s serverless inference** model of LLaMA 2.

2. **Caregiver Dashboard with Forecasting Capabilities**:
   - **Functionality**: Provides real-time insights and predictive analytics for caregivers, enabling them to track and adjust therapy plans.

3. **Real-Time Adaptive Cognitive Tracking**:
   - **Model**: Reformer architecture, integrated with Emotiv EEG data.
   - **Functionality**: Analyzes cognitive response to dynamically adjust task difficulty based on real-time EEG metrics.
